description: Updating the MoodMend Logo
---

To update the logo:
1.  Prepare your logo as a square PNG (512x512 is best).
2.  Rename it to `pwa-512x512.png`.
3.  Create a smaller version (192x192) named `pwa-192x192.png`.
4.  Replace the files in `frontend/public/` with your new images.
5.  Also create `favicon.ico` and replace `frontend/public/favicon.ico`.
6.  Rebuild: `npm run build`.
